Rainbows are one of nature’s most beautiful and fascinating sights. But how exactly are they made? Let’s break it down in simple terms.

A rainbow happens when sunlight and water work together in a special way. Here’s how it works:

1. **Sunlight is made up of many colors**  
   Even though sunlight looks white, it actually contains all the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These colors are all mixed together, and we don’t normally see them separately.

2. **Water droplets in the air**  
   Rainbows usually appear when it’s raining or after a rain shower, but the sun needs to be shining, too. Water droplets in the air act like tiny prisms. A prism is something that can split light into different colors.

3. **Light bends and reflects**  
   When sunlight enters a water droplet, it bends or refracts. This bending causes the light to spread out into its separate colors. Inside the droplet, the light also reflects or bounces off the back of the droplet. Then, when the light leaves the droplet, it bends again.

4. **The colors spread out**  
   Because each color of light bends at a slightly different angle, the colors spread out and form a circle of light in the sky. We see this circle as a rainbow. Red light bends the least, so it appears on the top of the rainbow, while violet bends the most, so it appears at the bottom.

5. **The angle matters**  
   You can only see a rainbow if the sun is behind you and the rain or mist is in front of you. The angle at which the light bends (about 42 degrees) determines where you see the rainbow. That’s why we only see rainbows when the sun is at the right position in the sky.
