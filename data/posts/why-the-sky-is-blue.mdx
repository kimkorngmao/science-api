The sky is blue because of the way sunlight interacts with the Earth's atmosphere. Sunlight looks white, but it is actually made up of many different colors, like the colors of a rainbow. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it hits tiny particles of gas and dust. These particles scatter the light in all directions.

Blue light has shorter wavelengths than other colors, so it gets scattered more. This is why we see the sky as blue during the day. The blue light spreads across the sky, while the other colors, like red and yellow, are not scattered as much.

When the sun is lower in the sky, like during sunrise or sunset, the light has to pass through more of the atmosphere. This causes the blue light to scatter even more, and the sky can look red, orange, or pink.
