Air is all around us, but we cannot see it with our eyes. This is because air is made up of very tiny particles, called molecules, that are too small to see. These molecules include oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases. Even though air fills the space around us, its particles are invisible because they are spread out and do not block light like solid objects do.

Light passes through air without being stopped. When light hits solid objects, like a wall or a tree, it cannot pass through, and that is why we can see those objects. Air does not stop the light in the same way, so we do not notice it.

Air can be seen in special situations, like when the wind moves leaves or when there is dust in the air. We also notice air when it creates clouds or fog, but that is because of water droplets mixed with air, not the air itself.
