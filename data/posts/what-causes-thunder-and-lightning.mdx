Thunder and lightning are powerful natural events that often happen during storms. Even though they can seem scary, they are simply part of the weather. Here’s how they work:

1. **How Lightning Happens**  
   Lightning is a giant spark of electricity in the atmosphere. Inside a storm cloud, there are many tiny pieces of ice and water moving around. These pieces bump into each other, creating an electrical charge. The top of the cloud becomes positively charged, and the bottom becomes negatively charged.

   Eventually, the difference between these charges becomes so great that the electricity wants to jump from one place to another to balance out. This jump creates a flash of lightning, either inside the cloud, between clouds, or from the cloud to the ground.

2. **How Thunder Happens**  
   When lightning flashes, it heats the air around it very quickly—up to 30,000 degrees Celsius (54,000 degrees Fahrenheit). This sudden heating makes the air expand fast, creating a shockwave. This shockwave is what we hear as thunder.

   Thunder always follows lightning because light travels faster than sound. So, when we see lightning, we hear the thunder a little later, depending on how far away the storm is.

3. **Why We Hear Thunder at Different Times**  
   Sometimes, thunder can sound like a sharp crack or a long rumble. This depends on how far the lightning is from you. If the lightning is close, you will hear a loud, sharp crack. If the lightning is far away, the thunder will sound like a low, rolling rumble because the sound waves have traveled a long distance.
